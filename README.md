## Description
This repository collects and analyzes data of top Chess.com players: profiles, ratings, activity, game statistics, and game archives.  
This repository contains Python scripts to fetch and process data from the Chess.com Public API, and Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis and visualization.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to study player behavior, analyze game activity, and visualize trends among top Chess.com players.  
It can be used for research, analytics, or personal learning.

## Users and Usage
This repository is intended for:
- Data analysts and researchers who want to study Chess.com player behavior.
- Programmers who want to run or modify the scripts for collecting new data.
- Chess enthusiasts who want to explore player statistics and trends.

Users can:
- Run the scripts to fetch and update data.
- Analyze the CSV files locally using Python or Jupyter Notebooks.
